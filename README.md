# comuso
Collection of header only C++ classes, many template classes, to do certain common tasks.

There are a few dependencies from other libraries, mainly mine and boost, it's easy to spot them checking the includes. When debugging, aka defining DEBUGJOUVEN, it depends on https://github.com/bombela/backward-cpp so it is require to link, dynamically, against it.
